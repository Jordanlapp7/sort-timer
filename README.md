Introduction
This Python project is designed to analyze and compare the performance of two sorting algorithms. It generates random lists of increasing size, sorts them using the specified algorithms, and then plots the sorting times against the list sizes. This comparison provides valuable insights into the efficiency and scalability of the algorithms.

Features
Generation of random lists of varying sizes.
Implementation of two sorting algorithms for comparison.
Use of Matplotlib to plot sorting times against list sizes.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Matplotlib library (for plotting the results)
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

Clone the Repository:

Clone this repository to your machine using git clone.
Install Matplotlib:

If you haven't installed Matplotlib, you can do so by running pip install matplotlib.

Running the Program:

Navigate to the project directory.
Run the script using Python: python sort_timer.py.

How the Comparison Works
The script executes the following steps:

List Generation:

Random lists of different sizes are generated.

Sorting:

Each list is sorted using the two chosen sorting algorithms. The time taken to sort each list is recorded for both algorithms.

Plotting Results:

Matplotlib is used to create a plot that compares the sorting times of the two algorithms against the list sizes.
Customization
You can modify the script to include different sorting algorithms or change the range of list sizes for comparison.
Usage
After running the script, the Matplotlib plot will display the performance comparison, providing a visual representation of the efficiency of the sorting algorithms.
